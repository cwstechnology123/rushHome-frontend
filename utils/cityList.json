Between 2000 and 2010, the population of the town grew 206.3%.  Many affluent housing developments surround the town's center, especially to its north, attracting, among others, commuters from Wilmington, and even Philadelphia. Middletown's commerce has grown accordingly. National retail and food chain stores have opened locations in the area, with significant growth along the U.S. 301 corridor. An Amazon fulfillment center is located in Middletown. This growth is more characteristic of suburban sprawl, a stark difference from Middletown's historic growth patterns.",
